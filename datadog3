APM(application performance monitoring)

--> APM is a collection of tools and processes to collect the experiences,to collect the response time,analyze the response time and that process is called APM.
APM gives you grouped views of your application's performance trends for quick and easy diagnosis of performance problems.
APM helps you understand and improve the relationships between your applications,your customers,and your business.

How to do APM?

-->1)Agent (this agent is different then datadog agent) DataDog agent is a infra agent 	here we need different kind of agent.
-->2)Agentless

Agent Based Solution: This is a solution where you have a piece of software,or an agent	if you will,injected within an Application.It will report back on what this application is doing internally along with complex metrics.
It will report  back on what this application is doing internally along with complex metrics.

Example: Java project will have all the applications in jar file,so you will deploy agent in a jar file.


#End goal of APM is simple
-->:Automatic reports
   :Alerts,and
   :Warning signals -> when your response time of your transactions start increasing,red flags are waved.When a transaction starts falling.

APM common terminology
-> Number of users ->Hits per second ->Errors per second(through http code) ->Response time ->Latency ->Connect time ->Throughput

#What is trace?
--> Transaction is a collection of traces and each trace is between the two endpoint.Endpoint can be two services or microservice or any functions calls.

Performance monitoring uses traces to collect data about these processes.A trace is a report that contains data captured between two points in time in your app.The collected performance data
for each trace are called metrics and vary depending on the type of trace.
