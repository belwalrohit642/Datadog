The agent is deployable via a chef cookbook or ansbile .It requires minimal configuration.

Integrations: Datadog has prebuilt integrations to pull data from almost every important service we use.

Events: Through the integrations datadog generates a consolidated event stream that we  can filter and search as needed.
The interface makes seraching and filerting events straightforward.

Dashboards: Datadog lets us build dashboards that combines metrics from many different sources. We can combine and transform metrics to make them more useful. It also provides an powerful interface for interactive exploration of metrics.

Alerting: Datadog has nice stream processing capabilities for generating alerts,and it can surface them in services we use like slack and pagerduty.
